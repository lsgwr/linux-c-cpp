To compile, just type 'make'.
On some distributions you may need to link the gdbm compatability
routines. The Makefile's have a comment showing you what needs
to be changed.

memory1.c -  A simple memory allocation program that uses the function malloc.

memory2.c -  A program that allocates 16 Megabytes of memory.

memory3.c -  A program that allocates all of the machine's memory.

memory4.c -  A program that abuses the memory causing a segmentation fault.

memory5a.c, memory5b.c  -  Two programs that attempt to access a null pointer causing a segmentation fault.

memory6.c  -  A program that allocates and then frees memory using the function free.

lock1.c   -  A program that creates a lock file using the funciton open.

lock2.c   -  A program that creates cooperative lock files.

lock3.c   -  A program that creates different types of locks using the function fnctl.

lock4.c   -  A program that tests the locks on a file.

lock5.c   -  A program that creates competing locks.


The programs below may need to be compiled with one of the commands, if the default Makefile does not succeed.

cc -o XXXX XXXX.c -lgdbm
cc -o XXXX XXXX.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -ldbm
cc -o XXXX XXXX.c -I/usr/local/include/gdbm -L/usr/local/lib -lgdbm

dbm1.c    -  A simple database program.

dbm2.c    -  An improved database program.


CD Application.

app/makefile  -  The application's makefile. (See Chapter 8.)

app/cd_data.h   -  The header file for the following files.

app/app_ui.c    -  The application's user interface.

app/cd_access.c -  The dbm side of the application.

To compile the application:
$ make
