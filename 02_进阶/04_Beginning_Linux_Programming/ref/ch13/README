Inter-Process Communication: Pipes.


popen1.c   -  A program that implements pipes using popen and pclose and captures output from
an external program.

popen2.c   -  A program that sends data to an external program using popen.

popen3.c   -  A program that reads larger amounts of data from a pipe by using multiple reads.

popen4.c   -  A program that start a shell using popen.

pipe1.c    -  A program that uses the function pipe to create a pipe.

pipe2.c    -  A program that passes data between the two halves of a forked process using pipe.

pipe3.c    -  A program that uses the functions fork and execl to create a child process and then
uses the function pipe to pass data from one to the other.

pipe4.c    -  The child process called by execl in pipe3.c.

pipe5.c    -  A program that uses a pipe between the standard output and input of two processes.

fifo1.c    -  A program that creates a named pipe using fifo.

fifo2.c    -  A program that can be used to investigate the nature of fifo files by using open.

fifo3.c, fifo4.c  -  Two programs that show how to pass data between unrelated processes using a fifo.

client.h  -  A header file for the forthcoming client and server programs.

server.c, client.c  -  A client/server application using named pipes (fifos).


CD Application.

app/makefile  -  The application's makefile. (See Chapter 8.)

app/cd_data.h, app/cliserv.h   -  Header files.

app/app_ui.c  -  Identical to app/app_ui.c in Chapter 7.

app/cd_dbm.c  -  Identical to app/access.c in Chapter 7.

app/client_if.c, app/server.c  -  Two files that interface old functions with new.

app/pipe_imp.c  - The pipe joining the client to the server.

To compile the application:
$ make -f makefile

To run the application:
$./server -i &
$./client
