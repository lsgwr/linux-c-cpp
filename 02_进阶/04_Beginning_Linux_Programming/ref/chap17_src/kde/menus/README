Programming KDE using Qt

KDE Menus examples

To build, first create Makefile using qmake utility:

$ qmake -o Makefile menu.pro

Then compile as usual:

$ make

N.B. May need to change menu.pro to suit your KDE installation path

qmake is distributed with Qt and should be made visible in your path.

If not, for example on SuSE 8.2 run qmake as 
/usr/lib/qt3/bin/qmake -o Makefile menu.pro 

and run the make with QTDIR set 
QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3 make
