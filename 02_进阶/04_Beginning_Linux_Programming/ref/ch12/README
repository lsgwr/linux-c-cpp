POSIX Threads.

On most recent Linux distributions the standard Makefile should compile these rpograms sucessfully. The alternative, makefile-explicit, is provided for any systems that need the include and thread library paths explicity defining.

thread1.c  -  a simple program using threads.

thread2.c  -  a program that executes 2 threads simultaneously.  You may have to wait a few seconds before
this program produces output.

thread3.c  -  a program that synchronizes threads using seamphores.

thread3a.c  -  a modified version of thread3.c.

thread4.c  -  a program that synchronizes threads using mutexes.

thread5.c  -  a program that sets a thread's detached state attribute.

The remaining programs may not compile on older Linux distros.

thread6.c, thread7, thread7a.c  -  programs that set a thread's scheduling attribute.


thread8.c, thread8a.c  -  two programs that create many threads, the a version corrects a subtle race condition.
